grep -E --color=name ro+t /etc/passwd| We use extended regular like + we must include -E, + meaning to search for one o or multiple o like oooo
grep -E --color=name ro?t /etc/passwd| ?: zero or one 
grep -E --color=name root\|shutdown /etc/passwdgrep -E --color=name root\|shutdown /etc/passwd| \| pipe search root or shutdown 
grep -E --color=name "root|shutdown" /etc/passwd| Shell quoting ", display same result above 
grep -E --color=name "(^root|^shutdown)".\*bash$" /etc/passwd|
grep -E --color=name "root|shutdown" /etc/passwd|
grep -F -f search.txt --color=name /etc/passwd| search for the words in search.txt in /etc/passwd

#### Fgrep Egrep: old fashion command that deprecated, and now we need to use grep -F and grep -E.

### Every command that is not built into the Bash shell is a program ( sometimes called a binary) that resides smewhere in the Linux virtual directory structure. 

          type grep 
       out: grep is aliased to `grep --color=auto'
above meaning that grep have defualt option that is color=auto        
                     
          unalias grep
remove the defualt option from grep 

Command|Detail
---|---|
whereis grep| locate grep files 
whereis type| cannot find information becuase type is built in bash shell
man -k which \| grep ^whreis \| tee -a studyme.txt| -k: find a kewword in man of command, -a: append result
locate word.txt|locate the file location
sudo updatedb|update the mlocate.db database
find / -name newword.txt 2> /dev/null | Find is flexible, / start searching at the start point and locate for all sub directories, if we put just / that meaning start from root and search all directories. 
find /home -name newword.txt 2> /dev/null| search in home directory
find /home -regex .\*word.txt|Match zero or on. 
find /etc -maxdepth 1 -name passwd| -maxdepth 1 search only in the directory and not the sub directories. 

#### File globbing| is when a file name is expanded in multiple file names that contain original file name
#### mlocate.db is the database the locate use to search, it is typically only updated on a daily basis ( i could't find file that just created ) so we need to use command sudo updatedb to update the database 
#### The whereis command will display files associated with a program, such as its man pages and its binary file, as well as any source file and info files
#### The locate command uses a database with file names to perform searches, making it fast than find. If the database is out-of-date, youâ€™ll need to use the updatedb command and super user privileges to get it updated
